# Student Result Analysis
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student performance data to uncover insights related to gender, ethnicity, parental education, and marital status, and their impact on studentsâ€™ academic performance in Math, Reading, and Writing.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
The dataset used is student_scores.csv which includes the following key features:
Gender
EthnicGroup
ParentEduc (Parent's Level of Education)
ParentMaritalStatus
MathScore
ReadingScore
WritingScore

ðŸ“Œ Objectives

Understand the demographic distribution of students.
Analyze how gender and ethnic groups are represented.
Study the influence of parental education and marital status on student performance.
Detect outliers in the scores.
Visualize key patterns using plots and heatmaps.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

Gender Distribution: The dataset contains more female students than male.
Parental Education Impact: Students tend to perform better when parents have higher levels of education.
Parental Marital Status: Little to no significant impact on studentsâ€™ scores observed from the data.
Outliers: Box plots helped in detecting possible outliers in Math, Reading, and Writing scores.
Ethnic Group Distribution: Group C is the most represented, followed by Group D and B. Group A has the least number of students.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations Used

Count Plots for gender and ethnic distribution.
Pie Chart for visualizing proportion of ethnic groups.
Heatmaps to show average scores by parental education and marital status.
Box Plots to detect outliers in subject scores.
